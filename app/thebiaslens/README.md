## Installation & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` for local development:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Available Routes

- `/` - Home/Search page with news article search
- `/analyze` - Article analysis page with extraction and summarization
  - Supports `?url=` parameter for direct analysis
- `/analyze/:id` - Shareable analysis route
  - Requires `?url=` to run since the id is one-way and derived from the canonical URL
- `/recents` - Recent searches (coming soon)
- `/settings` - User preferences (coming soon)
- `/details/:id` - Article details (coming soon)

## Key User Flows

### Search to Analysis Flow

1. User searches for articles on the main page
2. Results display with "Analyze" buttons for each article
3. Clicking "Analyze" navigates to `/analyze?url=<article-url>`
4. Analysis page automatically extracts and summarizes the article
5. User can view metadata, summary, and full text

### Direct Analysis Flow

1. User visits `/analyze` page directly
2. Enters article URL manually
3. System extracts content and generates summary
4. Results display with copy functionality
5. Optionally share using the clean route `/analyze/:id?url=<article-url>`
