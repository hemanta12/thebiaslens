# TheBiasLens

A web service that analyzes news content for political framing, generates article summaries, and provides content extraction capabilities with bias detection potential.

## Overview

TheBiasLens consists of two main components:

- **API Server**: FastAPI backend with article extraction, summarization, and configurable news providers
- **Web App**: React + TypeScript frontend with responsive UI, search functionality, and analysis tools

## Features

### Current Features âœ…

- **News Search**: Search articles from multiple news providers (currently NewsAPI)
- **Article Extraction**: Extract full article content from URLs using trafilatura
- **Text Summarization**: Generate lead-3 summaries from extracted content
- **Bias Analysis UI**: Visual political bias meter with Left/Neutral/Right labels
- **Combined Analysis**: Single-endpoint analysis combining extraction, summarization, and bias detection
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first UI with Material-UI components
- **Search to Analysis Flow**: Click "Analyze" buttons in search results to automatically extract and summarize articles
- **Real-time Updates**: Live search results with loading states and error handling
- **Unified Analysis UI**: Integrated card layout combining metadata, bias analysis, and summary
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copy for summaries with visual feedback
- **Shareable Analysis Links**: Deterministic analysis ids enable clean links like `/analyze/:id?url=...`
- **Open/Copy/Share Actions**: Open canonical article, copy app link with feedback, or share via Web Share API
- **Canonical URL Detection**: Extracts and reports canonical URL per page metadata
- **Sources & Citations**: Primary source plus up to 5 referenced links deduped by host
- **UX Polishing**: Clear (X) button on URL input, subtle skeletons for actions/sources, footer disclaimer

### Planned Features ðŸš§

- **Bias ML Model**: Implementation of the political framing detection algorithm
- **Fact-check Integration**: Surface fact-check snippets with citations
- **User Preferences**: Saved searches and bookmarks
- **Historical Analysis**: Track bias trends over time

## Quick Start

1. **Start the API server**:

   ```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Start the web app**:

   ```bash
   cd app/thebiaslens
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Configure environment**:
   - Set `NEWS_API_KEY` in `api/.env` for live news data
   - Without API key, uses mock data for development

## Usage Flow

1. **Search for News**: Use the search interface to find articles on topics of interest
2. **Analyze Articles**: Click "Analyze" buttons in search results to extract and summarize content
3. **Review Results**: View extracted article metadata, content, and AI-generated summaries
4. **Navigate Seamlessly**: Switch between search and analysis with automatic URL parameter handling
5. **Share Results**: Use Copy/Share actions to share a stable link to the analysis

### Direct Link Formats

- Analyze by URL query:
  - `/analyze?url=<article-url>`
- Analyze by deterministic id (clean route):
  - `/analyze/<id>?url=<article-url>`

Note: `id` is derived from the canonicalized URL (sha256â†’base32) and cannot be reversed; the `url` query is required to run the analysis.
